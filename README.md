Student Academic Performance Machine Learning Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that focuses on predicting student academic performance using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify student performance based on various features and attributes. The SVM algorithm has been utilized due to its effectiveness in handling both linear and non-linear classification problems.

Dataset
The project utilizes the Student Performance Dataset, which includes a range of attributes such as student demographics, socio-economic factors, study habits, and past academic performance.

Project Structure
data/: This directory contains the dataset files used for training and evaluation.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks are used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models/: Saved trained SVM models for future use or deployment.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
results/: Results and evaluation metrics obtained from the trained models.
Installation
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/academic-performance-svm.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd academic-performance-svm
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.
Follow the instructions within the notebooks to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the SVM model, and evaluate its performance.
Experiment with different hyperparameters and feature engineering techniques to improve the model's accuracy.
Results
After training and evaluating the SVM model, the following results were obtained:

Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 87%
Recall: 83%
F1-Score: 85%
