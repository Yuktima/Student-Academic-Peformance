This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that focuses on predicting student academic performance using Support Vector Classifier (SVC).

Overview
This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm from the scikit-learn library. The aim is to analyze various factors influencing student performance and build a predictive model.

Dataset:-
The project utilizes the Student Performance Dataset (data.csv), which includes a range of attributes such as student demographics, socio-economic factors, study habits, and past academic performance.

Project Structure:-
- `main.py`: Main script to preprocess data and train the SVC model.
- `data.csv`: Dataset used in the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
  
Installation:-
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Yuktima/Student-Academic-Peformance.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Student-Academic-Peformance
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:-
1. Run the `main.py` Jupyter Notebook to see the data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
2. Modify the notebook to experiment with different feature selections, hyperparameter tuning, or other techniques.
3. Feel free to explore and enhance the project based on your requirements.

Results:-
After training and evaluating the SVC model, the following results were obtained:

- Accuracy: 85%
- Precision: 87%
- Recall: 83%
- F1-Score: 85%
